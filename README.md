# Advent of Code 2018 with Node.js 10

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018/about) is an Advent
calendar of small programming puzzles
for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be
solved in any programming language you like.
[47,000 people](https://adventofcode.com/2018/stats) are playing in 2018.

Some of my solutions are live streamed and the recordings are available in this
[playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL65pp6Tpk6913swH54jCu6VWGgWUV-5tV).

How did you solve the puzzles?
